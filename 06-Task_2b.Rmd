## b) Ranking the teams
In Tippeligaen a win gives 3 points, a loss gives 0 points and a draw gives 1 point. If two teams have the same number of points the ranking is determined by the goal difference. This is used to produce a ranking from the dataset of match results. 
```{r}
ranking <- function(tippeliga){
scores = data.frame(matrix(0,nrow=16,ncol=2))
row.names(scores) <- tippeliga$home[1:16]
colnames(scores) <- c("Points","GD") #GD=Goal Difference

for(i in 1:nrow(tippeliga)){
  home <- tippeliga$home[i]
  away <- tippeliga$away[i]
  yh <- tippeliga$yh[i]
  ya <- tippeliga$ya[i]
  if(yh > ya){ #Home team wins
    scores[home,1] = scores[home,1]+3
  }else if(yh < ya){ #Away team wins
    scores[away,1] = scores[away,1]+3
  }else{ #Draw
    scores[home,1] = scores[home,1]+1
    scores[away,1] = scores[away,1]+1
  }
  #Goal Differences
  scores[home,2] = scores[home,2] + yh-ya
  scores[away,2] = scores[away,2] - yh+ya
}
scores = scores[order(scores$Points,scores$GD,decreasing = TRUE),] #Sorting
return(scores)
}
```

```{r}
ranking(tippeliga)

```
This is the same results as given in the [Wikipedia article on Tippeligaen 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Tippeligaen).
